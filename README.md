# wikipedia-symptoms

This is the app running at http://wordcloud.adelriosantiago.com.

To run it you will also need https://github.com/adelriosantiago/wikipedia2mongodb, which will populate the database "medicine" with lots of documents from wikipedia.

After the "medicine" database has been created launch this app with `npm install`, `npm start` and go to localhost:4040.
